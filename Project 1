Key functionalities of the web application include:

Validation of documents: The system will validate submitted documents to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Blacklisting: Capability to blacklist pharmacies based on predefined criteria.

Approval process: Ability to review and approve new pharmacy registrations.

Advanced accreditation process: Streamlined process for advanced accreditation requirements.

E-signatures: Integration of e-signatures for authentication and authorization purposes.

Additionally, the project includes the development of a web form for existing pharmacies to request updates to their profiles. This form will feature built-in validations and allow pharmacies to request changes such as address updates, email address changes, contact number modifications, and manager details adjustments. Upon submission, the updated information will be transmitted to Salesforce and seamlessly linked to the respective pharmacy's account for immediate management by the Pharmacy Team.

Overall, this project aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in the registration and profile update processes for pharmacies, ultimately improving operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
